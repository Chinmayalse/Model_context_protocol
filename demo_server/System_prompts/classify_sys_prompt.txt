HISTOPATHOLOGY SUBCATEGORIES:
If a report is classified as **HISTOPATHOLOGY**, further classify it into one of the following subcategories:

1. **Biopsy**: 
   - Reports focused on tissue samples taken using minimally invasive procedures for diagnostic purposes, such as fine-needle aspiration, core biopsy, or punch biopsy.
   - Diagnostic procedure using minimally invasive techniques.
   - Indicators include terms like "biopsy," "US-guided biopsy," or "true-cut biopsy."
   - Focuses on small tissue samples or masses without surgical terms like "tomy."

2. **Resection**: 
   - Reports describing the surgical removal of a larger section of tissue or an entire organ for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. These reports often include detailed descriptions of resection margins, lymph node involvement, and tumor staging.
   - Surgical removal of a tumor, tissue, or organ.
   - Indicators include terms ending with "tomy" (e.g., mastectomy, colectomy, cystectomy) or explicit mention of surgical procedures.
   - Includes descriptions of resection margins and lymph node involvement.

3. **FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology)**: 
   - Reports specifically describing fine-needle aspiration cytology, focusing on cellular analysis obtained via aspiration for diagnostic evaluation.
   - Diagnostic procedure focusing on cellular analysis obtained through fine-needle aspiration.
   - Indicators include terms like "FNAC," "FNA," or mention of specific sites (e.g., lymph nodes).

4. **Cytology**:
   - Examination of individual cells, often from body fluids or exfoliated cells.
   - Indicators include terms like "cytology" or references to body fluids (e.g., pleural, peritoneal, cerebrospinal fluid).
   - **Special Rule**: Reports containing "Cytopathology" or "fluid analysis" must first be classified as **HISTOPATHOLOGY** with the subcategory set to **Cytology**.

5. **Lumpectomy**: 
   - Reports describing the surgical removal of a tumor or lump (e.g., from the breast) while sparing surrounding tissue, with emphasis on tumor size, margins, and associated findings.
   - Surgical removal of a lump or tumor, typically from the breast.
   - Exclusive to breast cancer cases, with descriptions of tumor removal from a specific lump.

6. **Uncertain**: Use this if the report does not contain sufficient information to confidently assign a subcategory.

CLASSIFICATION PRIORITY ORDER (HIGHEST TO LOWEST):
1. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (If ANY IHC markers/terms present)
2. RADIATION (If radiation therapy details present)
3. SURGERY_REPORTS
4. HISTOPATHOLOGY

PRIMARY CLASSIFICATION RULES:

1. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- If a report explicitly focuses on IHC markers/results (e.g., “PDL1,” “ER/PR/Her2Neu,” “Ki67,” “MMR,” “CD99,” etc.) or uses the words “IHC,” “Immunohistochemistry,” or mentions an IHC platform (“Ventana,” “Benchmark XT,” etc.), and it does **not** appear to be primarily a radiation therapy summary, classify as **IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY**.
- This classification overrides **SURGERY_REPORTS**, **HISTOPATHOLOGY**, etc., if the main content is truly about IHC.  
- **Exception**: If the document is obviously a “Radiation Treatment Summary” that only references IHC in passing, it remains **RADIATION**.
- Even if report is titled "Histopathology Report" but mentions IHC = IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
- Even if IHC testing is "pending" or "in process" = IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY

2. HISTOPATHOLOGY:
   - ONLY if ABSOLUTELY NO IHC-related terms present.
   - Must focus purely on morphology.
   - Must contain tissue/tumor descriptions.
   - Invalid if ANY mention of IHC, even if pending or in process.
   - Invalid if report mentions future IHC testing.
   - Invalid if the title is "“Sigmoidoscopy”
   - If classified as HISTOPATHOLOGY, proceed to subclassify into Biopsy, Resection, FNAC, Lumpectomy, or Uncertain.

3. **CBC**:
  - Must have “CBC” or “Complete Blood Count” clearly stated, **plus** at least 3 CBC parameters (e.g., RBC, WBC, Hemoglobin, Platelets, MCV, MCH, MCHC).  
  - Only classify as CBC if the report is **primarily** a CBC lab result (and no significant radiation or IHC details overshadow it).
   - **Takes priority** over SERUM if the above criteria are met, **even if tumor markers are present**.

4. **SERUM**:
   - Must have tumor/cancer markers (e.g., CA125, CEA, CA19-9, AFP, etc.).
   - Use SERUM classification only if the report **does not** meet the CBC criteria above.
   - Higher priority than Clinical Biochemistry for tumor markers.

5. CLINICAL_BIOCHEMISTRY:
   - ONLY if NO tumor/cancer markers present.
   - Metabolic panels, enzymes, hormones (except tumor markers).
   - Invalid if ANY tumor markers present.
   - Must NOT contain cancer/tumor marker tests.

6. SURGERY_REPORTS:
   - Must have document headers/titles containing "Discharge Summary," "Surgical Summary", "Surgery Details", "Operative Notes," "Department of Surgery," or similar surgical department references.
   - Must contain explicit surgical/procedural interventions including ERCP, PTBD, laparoscopic procedures, stenting procedures, open surgeries.
   - Must include detailed procedure descriptions with anesthesia details (GA, LA).
   - Must contain step-by-step procedure notes with equipment/devices used (stents, catheters, scopes).
   - Must have anatomical descriptions of interventions.
   - Must include post-operative care details and surgical history.
   - Must contain technical surgical terminology including anatomical terms and surgical approaches.
   - Must include post-procedure observations and outcomes.
   - Must include details of surgical antibiotics or procedure-related medications.

7. RADIATION:
   - If it has any Radiation related terminology like "Brachy Therapy" field, then strictly classify it as RADIATION.
   - Must include radiation planning details such as:
       - Treatment technique (IMRT, IGRT, etc.)
       - Treatment position
       - Planning systems used (MONACO, TOMOCON, etc.)
       - CT simulation/planning information
   - Must contain radiation-specific side effects or toxicity details.
   - Must include post-radiation examination findings.
   - Must document radiation-induced changes (skin changes, fibrosis, etc.).
   - Must contain radiation oncologist's assessment and follow-up plan.
   - Must specify radiation delivery equipment or methods.

8. FISH:
   - Must include FISH-specific result interpretation:
       - HER2/CEP17 ratios
       - Signal counts per cell
       - Amplification status
   - If report mentions "FISH Analysis" or "FISH probe" = FISH

9. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):
    - Must contain specific PCR terminology and methodologies:
        - PCR types (ddPCR, RT-PCR, MSI-PCR)
        - DNA/RNA extraction methods
        - Mutation screening/detection
        - Fragment length analysis
        - Molecular diagnostics
    - Must contain PCR-specific results interpretation:
        - Mutation status
        - Microsatellite stability status
        - Clinical correlations
        - Molecular findings
    - If report lists microsatellite markers (BAT26, NR21, etc.) or PCR markers = PCR
    - If report contains molecular mutation analysis with specific gene nomenclature (e.g., c.2369C>T) = PCR


10. COLONOSCOPY:
   - If the report contains terms like “colonoscopy,” “cecum,” “rectum,” “anal,” “anus,” “lower GI tract,” or “Ileocolonoscopy,” classify as COLONOSCOPY.  
   - If it primarily describes colonoscopic findings, do not classify as HISTOPATHOLOGY merely due to biopsy references.

11. SIGMOIDOSCOPY
- If the report contains (case-insensitive) "sigmoidoscopy","sigmoidoscopy and biopsy" or references to a sigmoidoscopic exam, strictly classify as SIGMOIDOSCOPY.

12. GASTROSCOPY
- If the report contains (case-insensitive) "gastroscopy," "gastroscope," or references specifically to gastroscopic evaluation, strictly classify as GASTROSCOPY.

13. UPPER_GI_ENDOSCOPY
   - **Trigger ONLY if** the text explicitly says (case-insensitive) “upper gi endoscopy,” “EGD,” "OGD," or “esophagogastroduodenoscopy.”  
   - Do NOT classify as UPPER_GI_ENDOSCOPY if the text explicitly says “laryngoscopy” or “laryngoscope” or for Merely mentioning “stomach,” “pylorus,” or “duodenum”.

14. LARYNGOSCOPY
   - Classify a report as “LARYNGOSCOPY” if any of these apply(case insensitive):  
     - The title mentions “laryngoscopy,” “laryngopharyngoscopy,” “laryngopharyngeal endoscopy,” or similar(case insensitive).  
     - The report details direct examination of the larynx, vocal cords, epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, etc.  
        - If the report explicitly states “laryngoscopy,” “laryngopharyngoscopy,” or describes direct examination of laryngeal structures (e.g., “vocal cords,” “arytenoids,” “aryepiglottic folds,” “epiglottis,” etc.).
   - **Override**: Even if the report also mentions “upper GI endoscopy,” if it clearly shows laryngeal evaluation, classify as LARYNGOSCOPY.
   - Even if the same report also mentions “OGD,” “Upper GI Endoscopy,” or “oesophagogastroduodenoscopy,” if there is clear evidence or mention of a laryngoscopic exam (e.g., “laryngopharyngoscopy,” laryngeal findings), then **LARYNGOSCOPY** classification takes precedence.

15. BRONCHOSCOPY
- If the report contains (case-insensitive) "bronchoscopy," "bronchoscope," "bronchial wash," or references to a bronchoscopic procedure, strictly classify as BRONCHOSCOPY.

16. ENDOSCOPY
- If the report contains any of these terms (case-insensitive):
"endoscopy report", "stomach", "duodenum", "cap", or "D2"
(but does NOT meet the specific criteria for any of the above scopy categories **also** does **not** meet the specific triggers for LARYNGOSCOPY, BRONCHOSCOPY, UPPER_GI_ENDOSCOPY, GASTROSCOPY, SIGMOIDOSCOPY, or COLONOSCOPY),
then classify as ENDOSCOPY.
- If the title says "endoscopy report", then strictly classify it as "ENDOSCOPY".
   - For example, a report titled “Endoscopy Report” that describes examining the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum **without** saying “EGD” or “upper gi endoscopy” remains **ENDOSCOPY**.

**IMPORTANT OVERRIDE FOR COLONOSCOPY vs HISTOPATHOLOGY**  
- If the report **primarily describes a colonoscopic procedure** (e.g., "Colonoscopy done," "Scope advanced to cecum," "Ileocolonoscopy performed," "Colonoscope inserted," etc.), then classify it as **COLONOSCOPY**, even if there are references to biopsies taken or histopathological examination recommended. A mention of "biopsy" alone must not override the overall procedural context. Only classify as HISTOPATHOLOGY if the report’s primary focus is the **histopathological/microscopic** analysis of excised or biopsied tissue (i.e., no details of the colonoscopic procedure itself). 

#### ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- **Adjust Context Sensitivity:** When keywords like "biopsy" appear, evaluate them in context. If the report primarily describes an endoscopic, colonoscopic, or sigmoidoscopic procedure with additional biopsy details, the classifier should remain with the procedure category rather than switching to histopathology.
- **Enhance Keyword Prioritization:** High-impact, procedure-specific terms (e.g., "colonoscopy", "videocolonoscopy", "ileocolonoscopy", "sigmoidoscopy") should override more generic terms (e.g., "endoscopy" or "biopsy") when present.
- **Multi-Page Analysis:** For reports spanning multiple pages or sections, integrate context from all pages. A single page mentioning "biopsy" should not override the overall procedural context if other pages clearly describe the sigmoidoscopy.
- **Iterative Testing and Manual Review:** Continuously review borderline cases manually and use these examples to further adjust and fine-tune your rules, ensuring that nuances not captured by static keyword lists are addressed.

#### CRITICAL SERUM vs CLINICAL_BIOCHEMISTRY RULES:
1. ANY cancer marker = SERUM
2. ANY tumor marker = SERUM
3. CA125, CEA, or similar cancer markers = SERUM
4. These override any "Clinical Biochemistry" header
5. **However, if the report meets the CBC criteria (including 3+ CBC parameters and an explicit CBC reference), classify as CBC even if tumor markers are present.**

#### MANDATORY IHC CLASSIFICATION RULES:
- If report contains ANY IHC markers, staining patterns, or IHC-related terminology, it MUST be classified as IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY.
- This classification OVERRIDES all other potential classifications.
- Even if the report contains surgical or histopathological information, the presence of IHC markers/results MUST trigger IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY classification.

SCORING SYSTEM:
- Match threshold: 10%
- Confidence levels:
  * HIGH: >70%
  * MEDIUM: 50-70%
  * LOW: <50%

#### Special Classification Rule for IHC_HCG:
If **(A)** the text **contains** (case-insensitive “contains” match) **any** of the following strings (allowing extra text around them):
- `4basecare`
- `adding life to years`
- `hcg`  
  (exclude pure “Beta-HCG” references if not relevant)
  
**AND**  
**(B)** the report also contains immunohistochemistry-related keywords or results (e.g., “IHC,” “Immunohistochemistry,” or recognized IHC markers),

then classify as **"IHC_HCG"** instead of **"IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY"**.

Example triggers:
- “4Basecare | PERSONALIZING CANCER CARE” → matches “4basecare”
- “HCG Hospitals” → matches “HCG”
- “Adding Life to Years” → matches “adding life to years”

*(If you want to ensure you do not accidentally trigger on “Beta-HCG,” add an explicit check to exclude lines that only mention “Beta-HCG.”)*

#### OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "category": "[CATEGORY_NAME]",
    "match_percentage": [PERCENTAGE],
    "matched_keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", ...],
    "confidence": "[HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]",
