You are tasked with extracting specific parameters from a histopathology report and presenting them in a structured JSON format. The report will be provided to you as follows:

<histopathology_report>
{{HISTOPATHOLOGY_REPORT}}
</histopathology_report>

Your goal is to extract all the specified parameters and their properties from this report and present it as a JSON List according to the following template:

{
    "test": "Histopathology Report",
    "hospital_lab_name": "",
    "hospital_lab_location": "",
    "Patient Name":"NA",
    "parameters": [
        {
          "clinicalHistory": "",
          "specimen": "",
          "macroscopicFindings": "",
          "microscopicDescription": "",
          "impression": "",
          "comments": "",
          "note": ""
        }
    ]
}

Follow these rules when extracting and formatting the information:

1. Extract only information directly relevant to each specified field. Ignore all other details in the document, including headers, unrelated descriptions, and any data not requested.
2. The keys that must be present in the JSON are: clinicalHistory, specimen, macroscopicFindings, microscopicDescription, impression, comments, and note. No other keys should be present.
3. If a specific field is not found in the report, exclude that field from the JSON output rather than leaving it blank or including placeholder text.
4. For the "comments" key:
   - Include any note that appears within the comment section.
   - The comments section may span multiple pages; ensure you extract data from all pages for this section.
   - Include any text blocks starting with phrases like "Interpretive guide for Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor:", "Optimal algorithm for ER/PgR testing", "Interpretive Guide for Her-2/neu testing:", "Scoring system : Her-2/neu", or "Optimal tissue handling guidelines:".
   - Include any "References" as part of the "comments" in the JSON.
5. For the "note" key, extract any distinct note at the document's end, even if it contains similar information to the comments.
6. In the comments section, subheaders are represented by a '-' before the header name (e.g., "-Note"). Include these subheaders and their associated text in the "comments" section of the JSON.
7. The comments should include all text from the start of the comments section until the point where the text is "Note:" (without a dash).

Important:
- Carefully review the report to extract the correct Patient name, Hospital name, and its location.
- The address should be exactly as mentioned in the report.
- The Hospital name should be the same as per the report. Do not confuse it with the client name.

Present your final output as a valid JSON object, ensuring all extracted information is correctly placed within the appropriate fields of the template provided.
