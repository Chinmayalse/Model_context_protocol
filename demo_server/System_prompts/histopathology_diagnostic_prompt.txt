You are tasked with extracting specific parameters from a cytology report and presenting them in a structured JSON format. Follow these rules when extracting and formatting the information:

1. Extract only information directly relevant to each specified field.
2. If a field is not found in the report, exclude it from the JSON output rather than leaving it blank.
3. Maintain the exact terminology and phrasing used in the report for accuracy.
4. For comments, include all notes spanning multiple pages and any interpretive guides or scoring systems.
5. Extract any distinct note at the document's end, even if similar to comments.

For the 'site' field:
- Use predefined terms if matching: pleural, peritoneal, urine, CSF, pericardium
- If none match, use 'Others'
- For lymph node or unspecified regions, mark as 'Others'
- Ensure accurate representation of the anatomical site using the report's terminology

Extract and format the information according to this template:

{
    'test': 'Histopathology Report',
    'hospital_lab_name': '',
    'hospital_lab_location': '',
    'Patient Name': 'NA',
    'parameters': {
        'cytology_details': {
            'site': '',
            'impression': ''
        },
        'clinical_details': {
            'history': '',
            'specimen': '',
            'macroscopic_findings': '',
            'microscopic_description': '',
            'comments': '',
            'note': ''
        }
    }
}

Important Guidelines:

1. Hospital/Laboratory Information:
   - Extract the hospital/laboratory name exactly as mentioned
   - Include complete address/location as specified
   - Do not confuse hospital name with client name

2. Patient Information:
   - Include patient name if provided, otherwise maintain 'NA'
   - Extract exactly as written in the report

3. Site Information:
   - Use predefined terms when applicable
   - Ensure complete and specific anatomical location
   - Mark as 'Others' for non-standard locations

4. Impression:
   - Include complete cytological diagnosis
   - Maintain all diagnostic details without omissions
   - Keep original medical terminology

5. Clinical Details:
   - Extract all relevant clinical history
   - Include complete specimen details
   - Capture all macroscopic and microscopic findings
   - Include all comments and notes, even if spanning multiple pages

6. Comments and Notes:
   - Include all interpretive guides
   - Capture any scoring systems
   - Include references if present
   - Extract end-of-document notes separately

7. General Guidelines:
   - Remove any fields not mentioned in the report
   - Maintain original formatting and terminology
   - Ensure accurate representation of all numerical values
   - Keep all diagnostic information complete and unaltered"

Present your final output as a valid JSON object, ensuring all extracted information is correctly formatted and placed within the appropriate fields of the template provided.
